Overview
 
 - research efficient broad-phase collision detection algorithms.
 - identifying spatial partitioning algorithms
 - technical report based on your research findings
 - minimum 4 pages and maximum 8 pages
 
Breakdown

1) conduct a literature review of broad-phase collision detection based on spatial partitioning algorithms;
2) select one spatial partitioning algorithm that you are going to implement;
3) compare and contrast the selected algorithm with other existing algorithms to demonstrate your understanding of these algorithms;
4) design implementation steps (data structure, pseudo-code, UML diagrams, flow-chart etc.);
5) summarize results

Layout

 - Format your report on A4 (21cm x 29.7cm) page layout.
 - Do not use page numbering within the final version of your report.
 - All text must be in a two-column format.
 - 

Extras

 - Offer possible improvements to the choosen technique
 - Suggest how the technique could be implemented in a given solution
 - Could the technique be used in other areas of simulation (cloth, hair, fluids)
 - Discuss simulation parameters and how changing said parameters with effect the simulation
 - Demonstrate awareness and understanding of the chosen algorithm for different types of state of the art physics simulations or graphics applications
